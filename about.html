         <h2> What is baseball?</h2>
         <p>According to <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/sports/baseball">Brittanica Encyclopedia's definition of baseball</a>, it is a "game played with a bat, a ball, and gloves between two teams of nine players each on a field with four white bases laid out in a diamond (i.e., a square oriented so that its diagonal line is vertical). Teams alternate positions as batters (offense) and fielders (defense), exchanging places when three members of the batting team are “put out.” As batters, players try to hit the ball out of the reach of the fielding team and make a complete circuit around the bases for a “run.” The team that scores the most runs in nine innings (times at bat) wins the game." But of course the execution of these three tasks are much harder than they sound. Some batters can hit balls up to 122mph and over 500f while some MLB pitchers can up to 105mph.</p>

         <h2> Where is baseball played?</h2>
         <p> Baseball has been and probably always will be one of the most popular sports in America because it is known as "Americas Pastime". The game is so popular that it has been adopted internationally in many countries such as Mexico, Japan, Korea, and several countries in the Carribean.</p>
