               <p> Everybody knows who Babe Ruth is whether you play baseball or not. He is probably the most infamous player of all time and for good reason. The interesting thing about Babe Ruth is he was both an excellent pitcher and hitter. Babe Ruth is MLB's all-time leader in slugging percentage (.690) and OPS (1.163). His 714 home runs rank third all time. But that's not the only stat in which he ranks third. Ruth's career ERA of 2.28 ranks third among starters since earned runs were officially kept in both leagues in 1913 (minimum 1,000 IP). Babe Ruth has the greatest WAR and second greatest OPS+ of all time. He only won one MVP during his career but this make him any less great. He led the AL in home runs 12 times which is also a record. During his 22 year playing career he posted a .342 BA(Batting Average), 714 Home runs(3rd all time) and 2214 RBIs(2nd all time). He played for the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, and Atlanta Braves.
                  He is also in the <a href="https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/ruth-babe" target="_blank">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> getting in on the fist ballot.

               </figure>
               <p> Even though Barry Bonds's name has been tied to steroid allegations, this shouldn't take too much away from his greatness. Barry Bonds is called the home run king because he holds the all time home run record at 762 home runs <a href="All_Time_Home_Runs.html" target="_blank">(Click to see the top 10 career homerun leaders)</a>. Barry Bonds also holds the all time record for total walks at 2,558. He was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_base_on_balls" target="_blank">intentionally walked</a> a record 668 times. This stat just proved how scary Barry Bonds was at the plate. Barry Bonds also holds the record for most total MVP awards won at 7. He also hit a record 73 home runs in the 2001 regular season. He was elected to 14 all star games for both the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Sanfrancisco Giants. He is the only player in history to have 500 home runs as well as 500 stolen bases. During his 22 year playing career Bonds batted .298 with a 162.8 WAR as well as a 182 OPS+(all elite). He is still not in the Hall of Fame because of steroid allegations.

               <p> When you rank second only behind Babe Ruth in slugging percentage and OPS, you must be really good. Ted Williams played for the Boston Red Sox for 19 years and racked up some impressive accolades. Williams is a 19 time all star, 2 time MVP, and a 2 time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_(baseball)" target="_blank">Triple crown winner</a>.

He also missed most of the 1952 and 1953 seasons due to the Korean War. He finished with 26,54 hits and 521 home runs. Since he left for the military in his prime, he would have easily finished with 3,000 hits and 600 home runs. He ended with an MLB record 190 OPS+ and an impressive 130.4 career war. He was inducted into the <a href="https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/williams-ted" target="_blank">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1966 on his first ballot.
