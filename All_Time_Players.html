<h2> What goes into ranking the Top 10 Greatest Players of All Time?</h2>
<p> Identifying the top 10 greatest baseball players of all time may be difficult, but not impossible. Various factors will go into ranking the top 10 greatest players of all time. These factors will include:

  <ul>
  <li>All Star Games</li>
  <li>MVP awards</li>
  <li>Longevity</li>
  <li>OPS+(takes a player's on-base plus slugging percentage and normalizes the number across the entire league)</li>
  <li>WAR(defined as the number of wins a player adds to his team compared to a replacement level player)</li>
  <li>Career Batting Average</li>
<ol type="1">
<li><h3>Babe Ruth</h3>

<p> Everybody knows who Babe Ruth is whether you play baseball or not. He is probably the most infamous player of all time and for good reason. The interesting thing about Babe Ruth is he was both an excellent pitcher and hitter. Babe Ruth is MLB's all-time leader in slugging percentage (.690) and OPS (1.163). His 714 home runs rank third all time. But that's not the only stat in which he ranks third. Ruth's career ERA of 2.28 ranks third among starters since earned runs were officially kept in both leagues in 1913 (minimum 1,000 IP). Babe Ruth has the greatest WAR and OPS+ of all time. He only won one MVP during his career but this make him any less great. He led the AL in home runs 12 times which is also a record.  During his 22 year playing career he posted a .342 BA(Batting Average), 714 Home runs(3rd all time) and an MLB record of 2214 RBIs(Runs Batted In). Pretty impressive right?
